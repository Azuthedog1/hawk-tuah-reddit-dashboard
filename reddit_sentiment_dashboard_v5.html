  <h1>Reddit Sentiment Dashboard (Posts + Comments)</h1>
  <p>
    This dashboard summarizes daily Reddit activity and a <b>dictionary-based sentiment</b> score computed from text.
    The score increases when posts/comments contain more “positive” words (e.g., <i>good, great</i>) and decreases when they contain
    more “negative” words (e.g., <i>scam, rugpull</i>). It is best used for broad trends, not precise measurement.

    <h2>Sentiment summary (averages)</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Overall average sentiment (combined):</b> -0.108 (computed over days with at least 1 post/comment)</li>
        <li><b>Overall average sentiment (posts):</b> -0.174</li>
        <li><b>Overall average sentiment (comments):</b> -0.186</li>

      </ul>
      <div class="small" style="margin-top: 8px;">
        Note: averages are sensitive when there are very few items on a day. Treat them as a “rough temperature check,” not a precise statistic.

    <h2>How to read this</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Dec 4, 2024</b> is marked with a dashed vertical line because it’s the day <b>$HAWK launched</b>.</li>
        <li>In your narrative, Dec 4 also represents the period where (reportedly) <b>within hours, large early holders sold off</b>, triggering the rug pull. Because this dashboard aggregates by day, those hour-level shifts show up as changes across dates rather than minute-by-minute.</li>
        <li>A score near <b>0</b> means the text is neutral <i>or</i> contains few words from the sentiment dictionary.</li>
        <li>Big jumps often happen on days with few items (small sample sizes), so treat spikes cautiously.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Dataset limitations (important)</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Sparse data:</b> This dataset covers 154 days, but only <b>22</b> days contain any posts/comments. Many dates have <b>no observable discussion</b> in these files.</li>
        <li><b>No true “before” window (in these files):</b> Days before <b>Dec 4, 2024</b> contain <b>0</b> items here. Any “before/after” comparison is limited by what was collected.</li>
        <li><b>Selection bias:</b> Results reflect the specific subreddits/keywords used when collecting data, not all of Reddit (and not other platforms like X/Twitter, Discord, Telegram).</li>
        <li><b>Text sentiment is approximate:</b> Dictionary methods miss sarcasm, memes, slang, and context (e.g., “this is sick” can be positive, but may be scored negative/neutral).</li>
        <li><b>Engagement ≠ representativeness:</b> High-score comments/posts can amplify certain voices; the loudest opinions aren’t necessarily the majority.</li>
        <li><b>UTC timestamps:</b> Dates are grouped by UTC; activity near midnight can shift into the “next day” relative to U.S. local time.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="small" style="margin-top: 8px;">
        Tip for your write-up: describe results as <i>“signals present in the collected sample”</i>, not definitive truth about everyone’s sentiment.

    <h2>How sentiment is computed</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <ul>
        <li>This analysis uses a <b>dictionary-based (lexicon) sentiment method</b>, not a machine‑learning model.</li>
        <li>Each post or comment is broken into individual words and compared against a predefined list of
            <b>positive</b> (e.g., <code>good</code>, <code>great</code>, <code>profit</code>) and <b>negative</b>
            (e.g., <code>scam</code>, <code>rugpull</code>, <code>fraud</code>) terms.</li>
        <li>Words found in the dictionary contribute positive or negative scores; words not in the list contribute nothing.</li>
        <li>Scores are lightly normalized so that longer posts do not automatically appear more extreme than shorter ones.</li>
        <li>Daily sentiment values represent the <b>average score</b> of all posts and comments made on that day.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="small" style="margin-top: 8px;">
        This approach is intentionally simple and transparent. It works well for identifying broad shifts in tone,
        but it cannot understand sarcasm, memes, or nuanced financial language.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Platform:</b> Reddit posts (title + selftext) and comments (body), aggregated by day.</li>
        <li><b>Sentiment method:</b> A simple word-score dictionary. Each text is tokenized, matched against a small lexicon (examples: <code>good</code>, <code>great</code>, <code>scam</code>, <code>rugpull</code>), and normalized so longer text doesn’t automatically dominate.</li>
        <li><b>Daily sentiment:</b> The dashboard reports the <b>average</b> sentiment per day for posts, comments, and a combined metric weighted by how many items exist that day.</li>
        <li><b>Why Reddit can look “bursty”:</b> Attention often clusters around news drops, influencer posts, investigations, or big price moves—so discussion appears in spikes rather than steadily.</li>
